 * The data spec a listing advertises, mirroring the episode record EgoVerse
 * exposes in Mecka's explorer (partners.mecka.ai/egoverse):
 *
 *   episode_hash · operator · lab · num_frames · task · task_description ·
 *   scene · objects · embodiment · robot_name · is_eval · eval_score ·
 *   eval_success · license
 *
 * A listing is a *set* of episodes rather than one, so the per-episode
 * singulars become arrays (`task` → `tasks`, `scene` → `scenes`) and the
 * counts are aggregates. Everything is optional except the three fields the
 * card can't render without, because listings predate this shape and get
 * normalised on read rather than backfilled.
